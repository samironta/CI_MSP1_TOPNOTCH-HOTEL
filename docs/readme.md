## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
Overall design philosophy is influence mainly by the user and client stories and by the fact that
the hotel is aimed at the high-end market, ideally customers are more influenced by the uniqueness of the experience rather than the cost. 
Hence the choice of colour scheme, layout, and typography.

## CODE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT

Code was developed using VSCode initially for conceptual purposes.

Main development was done using GitHub and Gitpod via the Code Institute Template.

As stated earlier this is a fictional site developed as part of an educational exercise.

It is hosted on GitHub pages and the site will be continually updated upon further code commits.

The repository is publicly available and can be cloned directly by using the fork tool on GitHub


---

## TESTING

Testing was done on a continuous basis using the live preview on Gitpod coupled with developer tools on the chrome browser. 

It was pretty much possible to get live feedback on every line of code or html element or styling. 

Additional testing was done by submitting code for peer-to-peer review on THE Code Institute Slack channel.

## PROBLEMS AND ISSUES
Image sizes for the carousel were different sizes which resulted in juddering effect while the images were scrolled through as every element on the homepage had to be repositioned
-	This issue was resolved by putting every image through an [image resizer](http://www.simpleimageresizer.com/)
- Had trouble with images stretching on mobile and tablet views but using percentages for sizing resolved that.

---

## UPCOMING FEATURES

The minimum acceptable product for the client was a static website which gives users as much information as they need but expects more dynamic and interactive features for future iterations.


-	Direct booking from the site
-	Handling credit card payments
-	Realtime room availability
-	etc
